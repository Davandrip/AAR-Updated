1. Pip install opencv python, face_recognition, pyttsx3 and pyaudio
2. Create an img folder
3. When installing face_recognition, you might get some errors about some missing dlib file, you can download the file for any of your python 3.7,3.8 and 3.9 versions depend on which you use. Put that file in a destination and copy the path to that destination, and do cd (path)  on your cmd prompt then pip install the dlib file, and your face_reg library can now be installed without stress.
4. For your cascade classifiers
- Locate your cv2 library on your system,
- Copy the data folder inside the cv2 folder
- paste in a folder called cascade(which you will create in the directory where you are working)
